## [당근마켓 모바일 실험실: Rust로 공유 라이브러리 만들기](https://medium.com/daangn/%EB%8B%B9%EA%B7%BC%EB%A7%88%EC%BC%93-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EC%8B%A4%ED%97%98%EC%8B%A4-rust%EB%A1%9C-%EA%B3%B5%EC%9C%A0-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%8C%EB%9F%AC%EB%A6%AC-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0-f4897a6dcdd5?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 라이브러리를 위한툴체인C 코드를 공유하는 방법은 플랫폼 개발자가 직접 사용하기에는 아무래도 불편함이있어요

 unimodules  commandLine cargo run p uniffibindgen generate cratespermalinksrcpermalink

 웹 플랫폼과의 코드공유UniFFI는 Kotlin과 Swift 바인딩을 생성할 수 있어서 당장 모바일 앱에서 사용하기는 수월하지만 웹에서 바로 실행할 수 있는 형식은 아직 지원하지않아요

## [신뢰할 수 있는 지표 만들기](https://medium.com/daangn/%EC%8B%A0%EB%A2%B0%ED%95%A0-%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%88%EB%8A%94-%EC%A7%80%ED%91%9C-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0-bbf39dc4a6b3?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 각 팀이 해석한 지표에 대한 정의나 계산 방식이 잘 공유되지 않을 가능성도 있고요

 그렇기 때문에 지표를 올바른 방식으로 정의하고 계산하고 전사가 지표를 통일된 기준으로 바라보게 하는 것 궁극적으로 팀과 회사가 데이터 기반의 신뢰할 수 있는 의사결정을 하게 하는 것이중요해요

 신뢰할 수 있는 방식으로 지표를 정의해서 관리하고 계산되도록 하는 이 전체적인 구성을 KarrotMetrics라는 이름으로 제품화했어요

 For alert queries that resolve to more than one data expression we align the incoming data points for each one of those data expressions on the same time boundary before emitting the accumulated values to the final eval step

 Whats more is we are now able to identify correlated anomalies and exceptions occurring in services that may be N hops away from the affected service

 Improved Alerting with Atlas Streaming Eval was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story

 In this blog post we will cover how the GraphQL layer is architected for use by our internal engineers to build member and customer facing applications

 The goal behind this is even after the introduction of GraphQL we wanted our API engineers to continue building and operating microservices

 With this we did a complete refactor on our existing client codebases to handle responses in GraphQL format irrespective of how the data is fetched
