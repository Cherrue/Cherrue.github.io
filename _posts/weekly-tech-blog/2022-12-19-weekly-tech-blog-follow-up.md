## [콘텐츠 브로드캐스팅이 가능한 CMS 만들기: 배민외식업광장 슬롯화](https://techblog.woowahan.com/9521/)

 슬롯화 된 영역에 모듈을 적용하여 콘텐츠가 노출되는 화면에 빠른 변화를 줄 수 있도록 하자

 이번에 진행한 작업한 내용은 3 4번에 대한 내용을 배민외식업광장 메인에 적용하는 것 였고 우리는 이것을 CMS 슬롯화 프로젝트라고 부르기로 했어요

 그렇다 보니 콘텐츠가 노출되는 영역의 위치를 바꾸거나 영역에 새로운 디자인을 적용하려면 반드시 배포가 필요했습니다

## [Accelerating Code Delivery By 97% With Yarn Workspaces](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/accelerating-code-delivery-by-97--with-yarn-workspaces)

 This meant we would be able to maintain the clear ownership and build isolation of our multirepo architecture while eliminating the need to utilize yarn link

 Moving our repositories to workspaces would also eliminate the need to version and publish packages independently

 In effect a change made to one package will run the tests for that package and any package that depends on it including the original suite of tests housed within the application
