## [중고거래 검색 필터 사용성 개선하기](https://medium.com/daangn/%EC%A4%91%EA%B3%A0%EA%B1%B0%EB%9E%98-%EA%B2%80%EC%83%89-%ED%95%84%ED%84%B0-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EC%84%B1-%EA%B0%9C%EC%84%A0%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0-71c9e000cfa3?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 검색 필터는 검색어 이외에 추가적인 정보를 활용해 사용자가 원하는 결과를 찾는 데 도움을 주는 기능이에요

 오늘은 검색팀이 중고거래 필터를 보다 사용하기 편하게 만들기 위해 노력한 이야기를 해보려고해요

 이런 불편한 과정을 줄여주기 위해 검색어마다 사용자가 선호할 만한 가격 구간을 버튼 형태로 보여주고 클릭한 값들이 필터에 적용되도록 개선해 봤어요

## [Hosted Search: LinkedIn Search as a managed service](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/hosted-search--linkedin-search-as-a-cloud-service)

 Additionally the level of search domain expertise and efforts required to set up and maintain or operate a SeaS vertical is rather high and the associated cost is not justified for the application teams

 When using HostedSearch application teams develop their custom logic in the form of custom artifacts which are dynamically pulled in to search resources that are set up and maintained and operated by the HostedSearch engineering team

 At the time of this writingHostedSearch is serving 70 use cases and is going strong in making it easier for the application teams to add search functionalities and providing enhanced capabilities to LinkedIn members

 As our platform continues to grow and evolve these techniques have become even more essential for us to deliver on our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce

 We use various methods to evolve our products and services from member surveys to indepth offline data analysis to online AB tests when we have a new feature that we think will benefit our members

 Not only does this work help us stay innovative it reminds us that everything we do is in service of our community and is to create more economic opportunities for our members around the world

## [Operating System Snapshot Automation](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/operating-system-snapshot-automation)

 The snapshot in OS snapshot comes from the fact that we take a proverbial snapshot of all of the locally available latest RPMs and bundle them together into an entity that is meant to be immutable by nature

 Once a snapshot is built and replicated the next important step for OSSA is to validate if we can install the newly minted test OS snapshot to a server

 The following figure describes the general workflow for OSSAs interactions with different external teams for managing the lifecycle of test and release OS snapshots
