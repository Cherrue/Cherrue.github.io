## [Service Delivery Index: A Driver for Reliability](https://slack.engineering/service-delivery-index-a-driver-for-reliability/)

 Organizationally it is important that we establish the correct forums and tools to understand ongoing regressions and for effective reprioritization of investments to strike the right balance between reliability and feature work

 Often wed find that regressions would affect our largest customers first as they pushed the limits of our products and infrastructure but that with this breakdown wed be able to resolve them proactively in the same way as the overall SDIR score

 SDIR has been so successful as an approach weve adopted it to ensure the availability of new Slack products and infrastructure as we scale in particular for our GovSlack environment
