## [Augmenting our content moderation efforts through machine learning and dynamic content prioritization](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/augmenting-our-content-moderation-efforts-through-machine-learni)

 To help our team review content faster and with more focus we created a new framework for content review prioritization which uses AI models to score each piece of content in the review queue based on how likely it is to have broken our policies

 With this framework content entering review queues is scored by a set of AI models to calculate the probability that it likely violates our policies

 However with this new content review prioritization framework we are using a new and technically complex approach to review prioritization which has the following hallmarks

## [Managing Slack Connect](https://slack.engineering/managing-slack-connect/)

 We created an index on source and destination team IDs which allowed us to efficiently query the table

 The other option was to create wrapper classes around each pref Protobuf message and have the store delegate tasks to these classes

 The implementer did not need to have any knowledge of how the store works and could focus on coding up the abstract methods
