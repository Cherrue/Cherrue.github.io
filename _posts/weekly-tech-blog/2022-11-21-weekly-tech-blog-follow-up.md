 일반적인 모델링에서는 속성들은 테이블에서 컬럼으로 표현이 됩니다

## [For your eyes only: improving Netflix video quality with neural networks](https://netflixtechblog.com/for-your-eyes-only-improving-netflix-video-quality-with-neural-networks-5b8d032da09c?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 The deep downscaler is our pragmatic approach to improving video quality with neural networks

 We employed an adaptive network design that is applicable to the wide variety of resolutions we use for encoding

 Improving Netflix video quality with neuralnetworksThe goal of the deep downscaler is to improve the endtoend video quality for the Netflix member

## [Match Cutting at Netflix: Finding Cuts with Smooth Visual Transitions](https://netflixtechblog.com/match-cutting-at-netflix-finding-cuts-with-smooth-visual-transitions-31c3fc14ae59?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 Whats needed in the art of match cutting is tools to help editors find shots that match well together which is what weve started building

 In step 3 we compute a representation of each shot depending on the flavor of match cutting that were interested in

 3 Compute representationsSteps 1 and 2 are agnostic to the flavor of match cutting that were interested in finding

# [Engineering at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/feed/)

## [Move faster, wait less: Improving code review time at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/16/culture/meta-code-review-time-improving/)

 By queueing up diffs we could encourage a diff review flow state allowing reviewers to make the most of their time and mental energy

 We use machine learning to identify a diff that the current reviewer is highly likely to want to review

 Then we surface that diff to the reviewer after they finish their current code review

## [Sapling: Source control that’s user-friendly and scalable](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/15/open-source/sapling-source-control-scalable/)

 Instead as you use the repository we download just the commits trees and files you actually need which allows you to work with a repository that may be terabytes in size without having to actually download all of it

 Id also like to thank the Mercurial open source community for all their collaboration and inspiration in the early days of Sapling which started the journey to what it is today

 I hope you find Sapling as pleasant to use as we do and that Sapling might start a conversation about the current state of source control and how we can all hold the bar higher for the source control of tomorrow
