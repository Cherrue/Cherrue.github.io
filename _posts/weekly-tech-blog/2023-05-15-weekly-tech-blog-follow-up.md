 유저의 취향에 따라 다른 상품 리스트를보여주자더 다양한 상품을보여주자먼저 유저의 취향에 따라 다른 무신사 추천순을 보여줄 방법을고민했습니다

 다음으로 어떻게 유저에게 더 다양한 상품을 보여줄 수 있을지 고민을했는데요

 결과적으로 유저를 세분화하고 취향에 맞는 상품을 보여주려 노력한 것이 효과가 있다는 걸확인했습니다

 Today we are introducing new ARCore Geospatial capabilities including Streetscape Geometry API Geospatial Depth API and Scene Semantics API to help you build transformative worldscale immersive experiences

 You can use this API to build immersive experiences like transforming building geometry into live plants growing on top of them or using the building geometry as a feature in your game by having virtual balls bounce off and interact with them

 Streetscape Geometry API is available on Android and iOS

## [How It’s Made: I/O FLIP adds a twist to a classic card game with generative AI](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-its-made-io-flip-adds-twist-to.html)

 Thousands of custom character images were pregenerated with DreamBooth on Muse and their descriptions were written using the PaLM API

 Much of the logic in FLIP is based on the game cards so theyre a good place to start

 Cloud Storage for Firebase stores all of the images descriptions elements and numbers that generate players card decks

## [Upscaling LinkedIn's Profile Datastore While Reducing Costs](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/upscaling-profile-datastore-while-reducing-costs)

  We converted from the existing cache strategy that employed OHC in the routers to the hybrid cache strategy implementing both OHC for hot keys and Couchbase for all reads that cannot be satisfied by OHC

  The cache contract between an application and Espresso is set with the HTTP header called the staleness bound header

 When the Profile backend application sends a read request to an Espresso router the router evaluates if it is a cacheable request based on the table schema configuration and the value set in the staleness bound request header
