 Git Flow Github Flow Gitlab Flow 등 다양한 Feature Branching 전략 뿐만 아니라 Mainline 기반으로 개발하는 TrunkBased Development 방법론도살펴보았어요

 Trunk 기반 개발을 더 살펴보다 보면 여기에도 Feature 브랜치를 사용하는 부분이 나오는데 Github Flow의 Feature 브랜치와는 다르게 지켜야 할 규칙이 있어요

 브랜치 전략에 Github Flow를 사용한 지 어느덧 반년 정도가 되었어요

## [Our Learnings from the Early Days of Generative AI](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/our-learnings-from-the-early-days-of-generative-ai)

 At the core our unique engineering approach is what enabled our teams to quickly move from ideation to exploration to deployment in less than three months so that we could get the latest AI technology into the hands of our members and customers to help them in their careers

 Dedication to Responsible AI  AI has been such an important part of all the products services and experiences we provide our members and customers on LinkedIn

 Part of being able to explore the ideas and uses of generative AI quickly has been because we can rely on aspects like our LinkedIn Responsible AI Principles to guide our work

## [Inside Look: Measuring Developer Productivity and Happiness at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/inside-look--measuring-developer-productivity-and-happiness-at-l)

 We aimed to address the challenge of fostering accountability among teams for their developer experience and metrics

 Soon after the launch of our product we learned that our users also wanted to onboard their own metrics for a more complete picture of their developer productivity

 We wanted to preserve the focus and simplicity of the original experience while still enabling teams to organize their own metrics in a meaningful way

## [Build faster with Buck2: Our open source build system](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/06/open-source/buck2-open-source-large-scale-build-system/)

 The core of Buck2 is written in Rust and its language rules like how to build C are written in Starlark

 This separation is in contrast to Buck1 where all rules are written in the core and Bazel where CJava are written in the core

 Its worth noting that Buck2 is mostly compatible with the BUCK files of Buck1

## [Tracing Notifications](https://slack.engineering/tracing-notifications/)

 We created a notification spec to understand all the events in a notification trace

 Developers use the notification trace data to triage issues

 However after notification tracing anyone was able to look at a trace of the notification to precisely see where a trace was sent and where in the flow a notification was dropped
