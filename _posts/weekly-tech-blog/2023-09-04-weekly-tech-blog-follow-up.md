 We approached Kinvolk to see if they could work with us and the Envoy community in implementing this feature

 We continue to use Eureka as the source of truth for VIPs and instance status which allows us to support a heterogeneous environment of some apps on mesh and some not while we migrate

 This is the first in a series of posts on our journey to service mesh so stay tuned

## [Enhancing Security and Developer Productivity: LinkedIn's Journey with Implementing Content Security Policy](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/enhancing-security-and-developer-productivity--linkedin-s-journe)

 From a process standpoint having a centralized architecture meant that the Application Security team was in the critical path to review and approve CSP changes for content updates on LinkedIn

 The Application Security team started to do some research into ways that could improve our current architecture and solve for some of the issues we identified

 One primary disadvantage in adopting a decentralized architecture for Content Security Policy customizations is that the security governance for CSP rules became challenging due to the following reasons

## [Open Sourcing iris-message-processor](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/open-sourcing-iris-message-processor)

 One of the most crucial issues that we wanted to address was the way Irisapi handles message processing and escalations

 To test the effectiveness of our changes we load tested Iris escalation processing before and after switching to Irismessage processor and measured the time between an escalation creation request being received and the delivery of that escalations messages to the appropriate vendors

 At this point the irismessage processor has been thoroughly battle tested so it is safe to fully move to processing all messages and escalations with the irismessageprocessor directly

## [Scheduling Jupyter Notebooks at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/29/security/scheduling-jupyter-notebooks-meta/)

 The ability to transparently answer questions about data flow through Meta systems for purposes of data privacy and complying with regulations differentiates our scheduled notebooks implementation from the rest of the industry

 We have integrated BentoOperator within Metas data purpose framework to ensure that data is used only for the purpose it was intended

 While weve addressed the challenge of supporting scheduled notebooks in a privacyaware manner the notebooks that are in scope for scheduling are limited to those performing ETL or those performing data analysis with no other side effects

## [Traffic 101: Packets Mostly Flow](https://slack.engineering/traffic-101-packets-mostly-flow/)

 The DNS lookup response is formed by a list of IP addresses for the region closest to the user

 At this point the user is ready to send a message on Slack

 Based on the domains that the requests came from Route53 or NS1 will point the request to the NLBs in a region closest to the user in terms of latency
