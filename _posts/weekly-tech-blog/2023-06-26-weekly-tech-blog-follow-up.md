## [VARCHAR vs TEXT](https://medium.com/daangn/varchar-vs-text-230a718a22a1?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 그래서 MySQL 서버에서는 레코드 사이즈 한계로 인해서 VARCHAR 타입의 최대 저장 길이 설정시에 공간을 아껴서 설정해야해요

 하지만 MySQL 서버는 LOB 타입의 컬럼을 항상 OffPage로 저장하지는 않고 길이가 길어서 저장 공간이 많이 필요한 경우에만 OffPage로 저장해요

 한가지 더 주의해야 할 것은 VARCHAR 타입에 저장된 값의 길이가 길어서 OffPage로 저장된 경우 MySQL 서버는 TABLE 객체의 records2 버퍼를 사용하지 못하고 새롭게 메모리 공간을 할당해서 사용해요

## [고객의 목소리를 한 눈에 볼 수 있도록: 무신사의 VoC 대시보드 제작기 Part2. by 검색플랫폼팀](https://medium.com/musinsa-tech/voc-dashboard-development-part2-a220e42c34e9?source=rss----f107b03c406e---4)

 검색플랫폼팀이 제일 잘하는 부분이 문장을 분석하여 핵심 키워드로 검색엔진에 질의하고 결과를 도출하는 부분이기에 검색플랫폼팀에서 VoC 카테고리 분류를 잘 자동화 할 수 있을 것이라고판단했습니다

 무신사와 같이 모든 카테고리의 문장에 분포되어 있는 키워드는 순위가 낮아져 핵심 키워드라고 보지 않게 될 것입니다

 때문에 검색이 아닌 머신러닝을 활용하여 카테고리 분류를 진행해보기로결정했습니다

## [Welcoming our inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Cloud North America cohort](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/06/welcoming-our-inaugural-google-for-startups-accelerator-cloud-north-america-cohort.html)

 The team at Harmonic Discovery is excited to scale our deep learning infrastructure for drug discovery using Google Cloud

 We also want to learn best practices from the Google team on training and developing machine learning models in a cost effective way

 ai San Mateo CA Duality AI is an augmented digital twin platform that provides endtoend workflows for predictive simulation and high fidelity visualization

## [A Look Back at LA #TechWeek OneGoogle Panel: Building a Startup Using Generative AI](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/06/la-techweek-one-google-panel-building-a-startup-using-generative-ai.html)

 Our conversation was as rich in depth as it was in diversity heightening the LA communitys collective excitement for the future of generative AI and underscoring Googles vision of harnessing the power of collaboration to ignite innovation in the tech startup space

 It was the embodiment of Googles commitment to driving transformative change by fostering robust partnerships with VC firms and startups  We understand that the success of startups is crucial to our communities economies and indeed to Google itself

 As we navigate this thrilling journey I look forward to continuing to collaborate with startups investors and partners leveraging the vast potential of AI to unlock a future where technology serves us all in unimaginable ways

## [Detecting Scene Changes in Audiovisual Content](https://netflixtechblog.com/detecting-scene-changes-in-audiovisual-content-77a61d3eaad6?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 As a result of DTW the scene headers have timestamps that can indicate possible scene boundaries in the video

 ConclusionWe have presented two complementary approaches to scene boundary detection that leverage a variety of available modalitiesscreenplay audio and video

 Longerform content also contains more complex narrative structure and we envision this work as the first in a series of projects that aim to better integrate narrative understanding in our multimodal machine learningmodels

## [Cybersecurity Professionals: The Unsung Superheroes of the Digital World](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/cybersecurity-professionals--the-unsung-superheroes-of-the-digit)

 We are responsible for building automation and guardrails to enable the business to move fast with security being the invisible guardian in the background

 There is a growing emphasis on integrating security governance and compliance as an integral part of business operations which in part is driving the sustained demand for cybersecurity professionals

 While most of it may go unnoticed by our members and customers the contributions that we are able to make to protect our business are invaluable in maintaining the experience that you have come to expect on LinkedIn

## [New Approaches For Detecting AI-Generated Profile Photos](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/new-approaches-for-detecting-ai-generated-profile-photos)

 This unique partnership enabled the creation of a novel approach for detecting a common type of AIgenerated profile photos that is lightweight and highly effective

 Our approach takes advantage of the fact that GANgenerated faces have consistent characteristics due to the way they are trained on cropped and aligned faces

 We validated our technique on a large sample of synthesized faces spanning five different synthesis engines and real LinkedIn member profile photos to understand the realworld performance
