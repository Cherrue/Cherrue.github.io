 Composing the DynamicSizzlePersonalizationWhen a request comes in for a sizzle reel our system determines what titles are in the Mega Asset and based on the request a personalized list of titles is created and sorted

 The top titles for a member are then used to construct the Dynamic Sizzle by leveraging the clips in the Mega Asset

 Finding TimecodesFor the Dynamic Sizzle process we have to quickly and dynamically determine the timecodes for each clip in the Mega Asset and make sure they are easily accessed at runtime

## [Building In-Video Search](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 The ApproachWe learned that contrastive learning works well for our objectives when applied to image and text pairs as these models can effectively learn joint embedding spaces between the two modalities

 While these models are trained on imagetext pairs we have found that they are an excellent starting point to learning representations of video units like shots and scenes

 Lastly shot embeddings can also be used for videotovideo search a particularly useful application in the context of trailer and promotional asset creation
