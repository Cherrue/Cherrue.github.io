 아직도 빠른 배송 생활권 서비스를 모르신다면 아래 그림을 참고해사용해보세요

 처음에는 빠른 배송 생활권 데이터가 워낙 많다 보니 느렸습니다

 TypeORM덕분에 DB에서 가져온 데이터를 Entity로 만들어주기 때문에 편하게 잘 사용하고 있습니다

## [Scalable Annotation Service — Marken](https://netflixtechblog.com/scalable-annotation-service-marken-f5ba9266d428?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 SchemaSince the annotation service would be used by anyone at Netflix we had a need to support different data models for the annotation object

 We extended this service to also describe the schema of an annotation object

 Given the requirements and the expertise in our team we decided to choose Cassandra as the source of truth for storing annotations

## [Unifying Messaging Experiences across LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/unifying-messaging-experiences-across-linkedin)

 The result is the Messenger SDK a collection of libraries for iOS Android Web and API that allow application developers to implement a fully capable and reliable messaging experience with ease

 The SDK toolkit is divided into two types of libraries API library messengerapi which is used to integrate messaging in an application API and client libraries messengerdata which is used to represent the mailbox locally on devices

 Because of this asynchronous nature of the data layer we decided to implement a reactive interface that allows UI libraries to be alerted of new data in the store regardless of when and where the data is acquired

## [Improving the customer’s experience via ML-driven payment routing](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/improving-the-customer-s-experience-via-ml-driven-payment-routin)

 Table 1 The relationship between payment routing terminology and variables used in the model

 We implemented a IPW based sampling approach and a supervised learning model based on the sampled training data to solve merchant payment routing

 We also want to include more predictors in the model such as time of transaction and issuing banks

## [Watch Meta’s engineers discuss optimizing large-scale networks](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/01/27/networking-traffic/optimizing-large-scale-networks-meta-engineers/)

 At the recent NetworkingScale virtual conference in November 2022 engineers from Meta discussed these challenges and presented solutions across these themes that help bring better network performance than ever to people using our family of apps

 FBOSS is one of the largest services in Meta and powers Metas network

 The talk also covers the connection of our submarine networks to our terrestrial backbone and describes how Meta designs and builds the hierarchies of the optical transport layer built on top of those fiber paths

## [Tulip: Modernizing Meta’s data platform](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/01/26/data-infrastructure/tulip-modernizing-metas-data-platform/)

 The charts below graphically portray the migration journey for the conversion of the serialization format to Tulip to show the progress at various stages and milestones

 The following engineering solutions were developed to ensure that the team was equipped with the necessary tooling and infrastructure support to switch the wire format safely and to debug issues that may arise during the migration phase in a scalable manner

 Challenge Endtoend testing and verification of data logged via the new format

## [What We Learned from Building GovSlack](https://slack.engineering/what-we-learned-from-building-govslack/)

 Therefore we had to spend a significant amount of time learning the differences between standard and Gov AWS and making changes to our tooling and the platform to be able to run on Gov AWS

 Therefore the first thing we had to do was to request a Gov root AWS account using our root payer commercial account

 We wanted to use the same modules for building our Gov infrastructure so we can keep these patterns consistent between AWS Gov and standard partitions
