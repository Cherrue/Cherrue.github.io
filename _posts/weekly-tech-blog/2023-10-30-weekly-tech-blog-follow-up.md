## [Kafka에서 파티션 증가 없이 동시 처리량을 늘리는 방법 - Parallel Consumer](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/7181840)

 Parallel Consumer를 사용하면 병렬 처리 단위를 파티션이 아닌 개별 Kafka 메시지 또는 유사한 단위로 지정이 가능하다

 Parallel Consumer는 Key 단위의 순서 보장 방식이 있으며 이는 동일 Key 기준으로 메시지를 순차적으로 처리한다

 위에서 언급한 순서 보장 방식을Partition Key Unordered Parallel Consumer는 어떤 식으로 구현하는지 살펴보겠다

 Dashlane observed an acceleration of passkey usage with 68 average weekly growth of passkeys saved and used on the web

 While passkeys are a new technology that users are just starting to get familiar with the adoption rate and positive engagement rates show that Dashlane users are more satisfied with passkey flows than the existing password flows

## [Passkeys week is here](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/passkeys-week.html)

 This week we are sharing resources to help you understand passkeys and upgrade authentication on your sites and apps

 Use PasskeysWeek to participate in the conversation and spread the word about your sites and apps  that support passkeys

## [Kubernetes And Kernel Panics](https://netflixtechblog.com/kubernetes-and-kernel-panics-ed620b9c6225?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4)

 This blog post shows how to connect the dots from the worst case scenario a kernel panic through to Kubernetes k8s and eventually up to us operators so that we can track how and why our k8s nodes are goingaway

 Configuring NetconsoleThe fact that the Linux kernel can even send out UDP packets with the string kernel panic while it is panicking is kind of amazing

 The annotations help document what happened to the node podA real pod lost on a real k8s node that had a real kernelpanic

## [Automating dead code cleanup](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/10/24/data-infrastructure/automating-dead-code-cleanup/)

 This automated dead code removal improves the quality of our systems and also unblocks unused data removal in SCARF when the dead code includes references to data assets that prevent automated data cleanup

 Falsepositives caught by engineers during code review are triaged and used to improve the analysis that SCARF performs and typically reflect new sources of dynamic usage that our augmented graphs must account for

 As mentioned in our first post of this series SCARF provides workflow management features that work together with the dead code subsystem to provide a cohesive experience for fully deprecating products and features

## [5 Things you didn’t know about Buck2](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/10/23/developer-tools/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-buck2/)

 The core of Buck2 is written in Rust with the rules written in Starlark a Pythonlike language and interpreted by our opensource Starlark library

 We hope you found this article insightful to show you what Buck2 is capable of and where you can use it for your own workflow

 Look out for more of these blogs where we discuss other DevInfra projects and interesting facts to help you get started with using them in your own projects
