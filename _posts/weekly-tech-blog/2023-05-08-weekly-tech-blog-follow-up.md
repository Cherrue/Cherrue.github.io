## [무신사가 카테고리숍 추천을 하는 방법](https://medium.com/musinsa-tech/%EB%AC%B4%EC%8B%A0%EC%82%AC%EA%B0%80-%EC%B9%B4%ED%85%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%88%8D-%EC%B6%94%EC%B2%9C%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-a45b219685ea?source=rss----f107b03c406e---4)

 유저의 취향에 따라 다른 상품 리스트를보여주자더 다양한 상품을보여주자먼저 유저의 취향에 따라 다른 무신사 추천순을 보여줄 방법을고민했습니다

 다음으로 어떻게 유저에게 더 다양한 상품을 보여줄 수 있을지 고민을했는데요

 결과적으로 유저를 세분화하고 취향에 맞는 상품을 보여주려 노력한 것이 효과가 있다는 걸확인했습니다

## [EKS Jam For App Modernization 워크샵 1등의 추억](https://medium.com/musinsa-tech/eks-jam-for-app-modernization-%EC%9B%8C%ED%81%AC%EC%83%B5-1%EB%93%B1%EC%9D%98-%EC%B6%94%EC%96%B5-cdf7cca2708f?source=rss----f107b03c406e---4)

 저희 팀은 맨 앞자리에 앉아 있었는데 그래서 좀 더 집중을 할 수 있었다고 생각합니다

 또 문제가 저희 SRE 팀에서 이미 사용하는 방식과 결을 같이 했기에생각보다는 쉽게 문제를 풀었던 것 같아요

 지금까지 AM핸즈온에 참여한 저희의 이야기를 읽어주셔서 감사합니다

 Preparing your data for training will look different depending on the type of model youre customizing

 You might need more than 100 examples to start if you need more to show the possible iterations of the data

 However I encourage you to first try out your model in MediaPipe Studio for a couple of reasons

 Here are some of the talks were excited for in developer productivity at this years Google IO

 Whats new in Kotlin for Android

 Sara Hamilton Developer Relations Engineer for Android discusses how we are continuing to invest in multidevice experiences and making it easier for you to build for the entire Android device ecosystem

## [Developer Journey: Explore I/O through the lens of our developer communities (May 2023)](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/developer-journey-may-2023.html)

 Participating in GDSC and GDG events is a great source to connect with peers and senior developers near you and across the globe

 For me Google IO is an opportunity to connect with passionate individuals in the developer community including students and experts from around the world

 There one of the most powerful tools for ontologists and data scientists to model and understand data are the canvases

 It also automatically expands to accommodate the size of the graph and volume of activity providing 9999 availability for our members

 First the complexity of the query and the variety of the data sources added to the Economic Graph will enable new features to be developed and surfaced

 This successful implementation has inspired other teams within LinkedIn to adopt it as a graph index and for sister teams at Microsoft to show interest in the technology
