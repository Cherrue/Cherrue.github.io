 여러 서비스를 더 효율적으로 운영하기 위해 저희 커뮤니티 트라이브 프론트엔드FE팀은 모노레포 전략을 선택했는데요

 이러한 구조에서 저희는 모노레포 구조를 잘 활용하기 위해 각 서비스가 가지고 있는 공통 코드를 분리하고 코드 패턴을 통일하는 작업들을진행했습니다

 저희 트라이브에서 진행한 모노레포 도입기는 무신사 테크의 다른 팀과도 공유하고 싶어 프라이텤에서 모노레포 도입 후 우리에게 생긴일 feat

## [Solving Espresso’s scalability and performance challenges to support our member base](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/solving-espresso-s-scalability-and-performance-challenges-to-sup)

 In the context of large clusters this approach led to millions of concurrent connections between the router and the storage nodes

 With HTTP2 migration we successfully solved Espressos scalability problems due to the huge number of TCP connections required between the router and the storage nodes

 The project demanded a great deal of time and effort due to the complexity involved in optimizing the performance
