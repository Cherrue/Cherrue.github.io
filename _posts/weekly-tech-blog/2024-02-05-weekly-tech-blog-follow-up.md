## [Carbon Limit’s concrete technology is saving the environment using AI](http://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/carbon-limits-concrete-technology-saving-the-environment-using-ai.html)

 Additionally the Carbon Limit team uses Google data for training their CO2related data and Google Colab to train their models

 Participating in the program also gave Carbon Limit access to resources that helped enhance their SEO

 The Google for Startups Accelerator program gave us valuable resources and guidance on what we can do how we can do it and what not to do says Tim

## [Improving machine learning iteration speed with faster application build and packaging](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/01/29/ml-applications/improving-machine-learning-iteration-speed-with-faster-application-build-and-packaging/)

 Engineers spend a significant amount of time dealing with incremental builds where packaging and fetching overhead of such a large executable surpasses the build time

 In response to this challenge we implemented a new solution for the packaging and distribution of Python executables  the Content Addressable Filesystem CAF

 The improvements we implemented have proven highly effective drastically reducing the overhead and significantly elevating the efficiency of our ML engineers
