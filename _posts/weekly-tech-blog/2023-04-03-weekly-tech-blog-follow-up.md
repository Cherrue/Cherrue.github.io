## [Career stories: Military commander turned Trust & Safety manager](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/career-stories--military-commander-turned-trust---safety-manager)

 My manager director and mentor are phenomenal they have been instrumental in easing my transition from the military fulltime to the corporate world at LinkedIn

 Trust Safetys ACE group that Im part of is specifically responsible for upholding the LinkedIn member experience and making sure members continue to feel safe and secure on our platform

 Soft skills are the key to success not only in LinkedIn and leadership but in life in my opinion

## [How LinkedIn automates cherry-picking commits to improve developer productivity](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/how-linkedin-automates-cherry-picking-commits-to-improve-develop)

 The Automated Cherrypick process creates new PRs to cherrypick the change to the branches specified in the original PR labels

 Otherwise approval is requested from the owner of the repository and cherrypick PR is merged after owner approval

 So whenever someone fixes a bug in the main branch they backport it to release branches using Automated Cherrypick

## [Evolving the LinkedIn Business Platform](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/evolving-the-linkedin-business-platform)

 Dimensions are constantly added and all of these dimensions bring complexity to the platform

 Lastly the business logic had to be rewritten for most domains in order to support the new vision of domains and to reimplement many business operations as workflows

 Currently all field and enterprise flows use new domain services and no longer rely on the OMS monolith
