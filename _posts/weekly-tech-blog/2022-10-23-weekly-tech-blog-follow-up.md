## [부동산 게시글의 방 구조를 쉽게 파악하는 방법](https://medium.com/daangn/%EB%B6%80%EB%8F%99%EC%82%B0-%EA%B2%8C%EC%8B%9C%EA%B8%80%EC%9D%98-%EB%B0%A9-%EA%B5%AC%EC%A1%B0%EB%A5%BC-%EC%89%BD%EA%B2%8C-%ED%8C%8C%EC%95%85%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-b0e6fa70052d?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 그중에 한 가지 사례인 부동산 게시글에 동영상을 넣어본 실험을 소개해드리려고해요

 솔루션 가설판매자가 부동산 게시글에 동영상을 업로드하고 구매자가 볼 수 있게함

 이것을 솔루션으로 사용하면 2주는 동영상을 부동산 게시글에 넣기에 충분한 솔루션처럼 보였어요

## [스마트 TV에서 콘텐츠를 새롭게 탐색하는 방법](https://medium.com/watcha/%EC%8A%A4%EB%A7%88%ED%8A%B8-tv%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EC%BD%98%ED%85%90%EC%B8%A0%EB%A5%BC-%EC%83%88%EB%A1%AD%EA%B2%8C-%ED%83%90%EC%83%89%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-66d303a6c65e?source=rss----bd1678892a27---4)

 이 기능이 재생과 직접적으로 연결할 순 없어도 UT에서 발견했듯이 왓챠에 이런 작품도 있었어요

 그래서 재생 성공률만 보는게 아니라 이 기능을 통해서 탐색하는데 얼마나 도움이되는지 알아보기 위해서 평가도 넣어서설계했습니다

 하지만 이를 통해 알 수 있는 점은 사용자가 콘텐츠 발견에 도움을 받았고 지표상으로도 약간의 재생 성공률이올랐어요
