## [당근마켓 프로덕트 디자이너를 소개합니다!](https://medium.com/daangn/%EB%8B%B9%EA%B7%BC%EB%A7%88%EC%BC%93-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EB%8D%95%ED%8A%B8-%EB%94%94%EC%9E%90%EC%9D%B4%EB%84%88%EB%A5%BC-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4-b00eeb80f65d?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 베일에 싸여있던 당근마켓 프로덕트 디자이너에 대한 모든 것을공개합니다

 당근마켓이 이웃들을 연결하는 것처럼 프로덕트 디자이너는 사용자와 당근마켓을 연결해요

 4 프로덕트 디자이너는 왜 당근마켓을선택했을까요

## [실험과 현지화에 흔들리지 않는 모바일 엔지니어링](https://medium.com/daangn/%EC%8B%A4%ED%97%98%EA%B3%BC-%ED%98%84%EC%A7%80%ED%99%94%EC%97%90-%ED%9D%94%EB%93%A4%EB%A6%AC%EC%A7%80-%EC%95%8A%EB%8A%94-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EC%97%94%EC%A7%80%EB%8B%88%EC%96%B4%EB%A7%81-3c648f2ac74?source=rss----4505f82a2dbd---4)

 당근마켓 iOS 프로덕트가 CleanSwiftVIP를 채택하기 시작했던것은 19년도 7월 쯤이였어요

 여기까지가 사용자 눈에 직접적으로 보이지 않는 비즈니스 로직에 해당하는 도메인 영역이고 담으로는 현실적으로 눈에 보이는 Presentation 영역에 대해서 어떻게 실험과 현지화에 흔들리지 않는 설계를 하고 있는지 이야기해보고자해요

 매너온도와 Karrot Score에 대해서 자세한이야기는 당근마켓 매너온도 글로벌 수출기를 함께봐도좋아요

## [내가 꿈꾸는 프로그래머로서의 삶](https://techblog.woowahan.com/9433/)

 교육이라는 것은 지식을 누군가에게 알려주는 것이라고 생각했는데요 우테코에서는 그렇게 교육을 정의할 수 없겠더라고요

 나는 어떤 프로그래머가 되고 싶을까 열심히 고민하다가 간지 있는 개발자가 되고 싶다고 작성했다

 그런데 아무리 생각해도 내가 왜 프로그래머가 되어야 하는지 모르겠다

## [Open Source Pass Converter for Mobile Wallets](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/11/open-source-pass-converter-for-mobile-wallets.html)

 jsonfile can be provided to the Pass Converter to map Google Wallet pass properties to custom properties in other passes

 If you want to quickly test converting different passes the Pass Converter includes a demo mode where you can load a simple webpage to test converting passes

 Later you can run the tool via the command line to convert existing passes you manage

 In this blogpost we describe one such problem and the tools we used to solveit

 This 1in8 chance is 125 matching our previous observation on the proportion of the fast nodes

 We reasoned that removing the obstacle of false sharing and increasing the overall throughput resulted in increased execution of the same JVM superclass caching code path

## [(Re)building Threat Detection and Incident Response at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/-re-building-threat-detection-and-incident-response-at-linkedin)

 The first was What visibility would the threat detection and incident response team need to be effective

 This enables the team to focus on the analysis tasks meant for humans and lets automation do the work of data gathering and transformation

 These are only some of the health checks and alerts we developed to ensure that our systems were logging and reporting properly

## [Career stories: From Hollywood videographer to frontend engineer](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/career-stories--from-hollywood-videographer-to-frontend-engineer)

 Everyone seems to genuinely enjoy coming to work and many of my teammates have been at LinkedIn for four years or longer

 Per the video below one of my most memorable projects at LinkedIn is Accessin which was a companywide initiative to make our products more inclusive and accessible to everyone including members i

## [Tulip: Schematizing Meta’s data platform](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/09/developer-tools/tulip-schematizing-metas-data-platform/)

 The logging schema is translated into a serialization schema and stored in the serialization schema repository

 The example above shows the creation and updation of a logging schema and its impact on the serialization schema over time

 The field in a serialization schema for a logging schema is indelible even if fields in the logging schema are addedremoved
