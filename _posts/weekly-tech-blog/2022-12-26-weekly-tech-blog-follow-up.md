## [무신사의 엘라스틱서치 MusE (Musinsa Elasticsearch)](https://medium.com/musinsa-tech/%EB%AC%B4%EC%8B%A0%EC%82%AC%EC%9D%98-%EC%97%98%EB%9D%BC%EC%8A%A4%ED%8B%B1%EC%84%9C%EC%B9%98-muse-musinsa-elasticsearch-e6355516186a?source=rss----f107b03c406e---4)

 검색 서버는 총 3대의 서버엘라스틱서치 노드를 1개의 클러스터로 연결하여 사용했었습니다

 이런 식으로 노드마다 필요한 설정을 추가한 후에 아래와 같이 쿠버네티스 명령어를 통해서 엘라스틱서치 클러스터를 생성할 수있습니다

 ECK에서의 엘라스틱서치의 노드 설정 부분은 아래와같습니다

## [New privacy-enhancing technology for everyone](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/12/new-privacy-enhancing-technology-for-everyone.html)

 Thats why for the past decade weve invested in researching and developing a variety of privacyenhancing technologies PETs like Federated Learning Differential Privacy and Fully Homomorphic Encryption that have the power to analyze large data sets in a provably private way underpinned by the highest technical standards

 Thats why three years ago we set out to help create a safer ecosystem for every internet user by democratizing access to these privacy technologies for all and have made many of our PETs freely available via open source projects in the years since

 As part of our work to expand FHE use cases we recently introduced new circuit optimizations for our transpiler that result in lower computational cost and time two of the biggest challenges

## [Meet Android Developers from India keen to learn and inspire](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/12/meet-android-developers-from-india-keen-to-learn-and-inspire.html)

 I experimented with a few methods in the Android Learn and Inspire series

 One thing was consistent in my Android journey and that was connecting with good Android developers

 I got trained in my first job from my seniors on Android and that motivated me to share my Android knowledge in the community

## [How to use the App Engine Users service (Module 20)](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/12/how-to-use-app-engine-users-service-module-20.html)

 The video and its corresponding codelab selfpaced handson tutorial demonstrate how to add use of the Users service to the sample baseline app from Module 1After adding the Users service in Module 20Module 21follows showing developers how to migrate that usage to Cloud Identity Platform

 Below is a screenshot of the modified app which now supports user logins via the user interface UI Sample app now supports user logins and App Engine admin usersclick to enlarge Below is the pseudocode reflecting the changes made to support user logins for the sample app including integrating the Users service and updating what shows up in the UI  If the user is logged in show their nickname display name or email address and display a Logout button

 Adding App Engine Users service usage to sample appclick to enlarge Wrapup Todays migration consists of adding usage of the App Engine Users service to support user management and recognize App Engine admin users starting with the Module 1 baseline app and finishing with the Module 20 app

## [Improving Video Voice Dubbing Through Deep Learning](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/12/improving-video-voice-dubbing-through-deep-learning.html)

 Subsequently we finetune the model parameters by retraining the decoder and attention modules with a fixed mixing ratio of the adaptation data and original multilingual data as illustrated in Figure 1  Figure 1 Voice transfer architecture Note that voice transfer and lip reanimation is only done when the content owner and speakers give consent for these techniques on their content

 To help with audience engagement producers of higher quality dubbed videos may put more effort into carefully tailoring the dialogue and voice performance to partially match the new speech with the existing lip motion in video

 That is we adjust speaker lip movements in the video to make the lips move in alignment with the new dubbed dialogue
