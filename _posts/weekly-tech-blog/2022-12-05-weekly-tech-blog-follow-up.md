## [작고 아기자기하지만, 개발조직의 문화 만들기 [ep 3. 소소한 단기 프로젝트]](https://techblog.woowahan.com/9766/)

 이제 프론트엔드 개발자가 없는 팀에 신규입사자가 오는 경우에도 운영진이 나서서 챙겨드릴 수 있게 되었습니다

 그리고 프론트엔드 온보딩 프로그램을 신설해보았습니다

 이 글을 쓰고 있는 현재 온보딩 프로그램의 운영은 주영 님운영진 1기 주관하에 진행하고 있어요

## [GDE community highlight: Lars Knudsen](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/12/gde-community-highlight-lars-knudsen.html)

 Lars I think that the first step is to look at some of the Fugu APIs that work in Chrome and Edge and are built into all the major systems today

 Are you planning on cooperating with any particular company and putting it into production for a fraction of the price of that expensive equipment

 Just being able to build whatever you want on the web and to use that to control any host computer opens up a lot of possibilities

## [How to use App Engine pull tasks (Module 18)](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/11/how-to-use-app-engine-pull-tasks-module-18.html)

 Push queues are covered in Migration Modules 79 demonstrating how to add use of push tasks to an existing baseline app followed by steps to migrate that functionality to Cloud Tasks the standalone successor to the Task Queues push service

 We turn to pull queues in todays video where Module 18 demonstrates how to add use of pull tasks to the same baseline sample app

 Adding App Engine Task Queue pull task usage to sample app Wrapup This migration is comprised of adding Task Queue pull task usage to support tracking visitor counts to the Module 1 baseline app and arrives at the finish line with the Module 18 app

## [When to step-up your Google Pay transactions as a PSP](http://developers.googleblog.com/2022/11/when-to-step-up-your-google-pay-transactions-as-a-psp.html)

 When processing payments stepup authentication or simply stepup is the practice of requiring additional authentication measures based on user activity and certain risk signals

 For example if the user selects a PANONLY card a card not tokenized not enabled for contactless from the payment sheet during checkout stepup is needed

 This indicates a PANONLY authentication method and therefore needs stepup

 Earlier we talked about the business logic of these sample workflows and we showed the Spark SQL version of that example data transformation

## [Building LinkedIn's Skills Graph to Power a Skills-First World](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/building-linkedin-s-skills-graph-to-power-a-skills-first-world)

 Together the Structured Skills and mapping to our members and jobs make up our Skills Graph and both are needed to unlock the full potential of a skillbased job market

 Structured skills enrich the set of skills for both members and jobs to ensure we can find all the relevant jobs for a member

 We do this by applying these tools to all member histories and all job descriptions on our platform which identify the skills that are likely associated with a job post or member job experience

## [TopicGC: How LinkedIn cleans up unused metadata for its Kafka clusters](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/topicgc_how-linkedin-cleans-up-unused-metadata-for-its-kafka-clu)

 The topic is deleted from the Kafka cluster

 The topic deletion helps to reduce the total fetch requests in the Kafka clusters and as a result the CPU usage drops significantly after the unused topics are deleted

 After we launched TopicGC to delete unused topics for Kafka it has deleted nearly 20 of topics and significantly reduced the metadata pressure of our Kafka clusters

## [Enabling static analysis of SQL queries at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/30/data-infrastructure/static-analysis-sql-queries/)

 Infrastructure teams at Meta leverage UPM to build SQL linters catch user mistakes in SQL code and perform data lineage analysis at scale

 Executing SQL queries against our data warehouse is important to the workflows of many engineers and data scientists at Meta for analytics and monitoring use cases either as part of recurring data pipelines or for adhoc data exploration

 UPM takes in an SQL query as input and represents it as a hierarchical data structure called a semantic tree
