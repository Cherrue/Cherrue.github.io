## [그 많던 문자열 배열은 왜 오브젝트가 됐을까?](https://medium.com/zigbang/%EA%B7%B8-%EB%A7%8E%EB%8D%98-%EB%AC%B8%EC%9E%90%EC%97%B4-%EB%B0%B0%EC%97%B4%EC%9D%80-%EC%99%9C-%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EA%B0%80-%EB%90%90%EC%9D%84%EA%B9%8C-171f57b1a295?source=rss----2f055286701b---4)

 express는 쿼리스트링 파서로 qs를사용한다

 qs는 쿼리스트링에서 어떤 배열 값의 인덱스가 20을 넘어가면e

 그럼 express가 어떤 쿼리스트링 파서를 사용하는지 알아봐야되겠습니다

## [Typescript로 보는 SOLID](https://medium.com/zigbang/typescript%EB%A1%9C-%EB%B3%B4%EB%8A%94-solid-e9384b208f6d?source=rss----2f055286701b---4)

 객체 지향적인 관점에서 보자면 변화하기 쉬운 것이란 구체화 된 클래스를 의미하고 변화하기 어려운 것은 추상클래스나 인터페이스를 의미합니다

 따라서 DIP를 만족한다는 것은 의존관계를 맺을 때 구체적인 클래스보다 인터페이스나 추상 클래스와 관계를 맺는다는 것을의미합니다

 즉 DIP를 만족한다는 것은 의존관계를 맺을 때 구체적인 클래스보다 인터페이스나 추상 클래스와 관계를 맺는다는 것을의미합니다

 Read on to see their outlook on their favorite Firebase and Flutter tools and the developers that inspire them

 What do you think is the most interesting or useful resource to learn more about Firebase  Flutter

 Eric Lately Ive seen an interest in using Flutter to make 2D games and using some Firebase tools for the back end of the game

## [Retrofitting null-safety onto Java at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/22/developer-tools/meta-java-nullsafe/)

 The problem however is not the null value itself but rather the lack of explicit nullness information in APIs and lack of tooling to validate that the code properly handles nullness

 This unsoundness is the price we had to pay to streamline and gradualize the rollout and adoption of Nullsafe in the codebase

 The effect of the checker is proportional to the amount of code compliant with this checker

## [PTP: Timing accuracy and precision for the future of computing](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/future-computing-ptp/)

 PTP offers a level of timing accuracy and precision that will be foundational as we continue to build toward the metaverse and develop the increasingly complex networks and systems it will require

 A network computer called a Stratum holds the current time and sends a time reference to any other computer on a network that asks what time it is

 To improve the precision of clock synchronization it is necessary to maximize the consistency and symmetry in our network

## [How Precision Time Protocol is being deployed at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/)

 A very important condition for this design to work is that all clocks be in sync or that the offset between a clock and the source of time be known

 The bottom line is that running PTP in datacenters in the absence of TCs leads to unpredictable and unaccountable asymmetry in the roundtrip time

 Imagine a situation in which a client is configured to use three time servers and the client is subscribed to a faulty Time Server e
