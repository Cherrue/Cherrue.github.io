## [#WeArePlay | Meet Tessa and Saasha from the UK, founders of waste-fighting app Olio](http://developers.googleblog.com/2023/06/weareplay-meet-tessa-and-saasha-from-uk.html)

 When they eventually met in college they bonded over their passion to help to save the environment through recycling and reducing waste

 But it wasnt until Tessa was one day moving countries when the idea for Olio came  she couldnt pack leftover food in airfreight and couldnt easily find anyone to take it

 Saasha instantly knew she wanted to help make this app a reality and so Olio was born

 1 TrafficPatternsWhile evaluating options to test anticipated load and evaluate our ad selection algorithms at scale we realized that mimicking member viewing behavior in combination with the seasonality of our organic traffic with abrupt regional shifts were important requirements

 Achieving this goal required extensive planning and implementation of measures to isolate the replay traffic environment from the production environment

 The availability of replay traffic 247 enabled us to refine our systems and boost our launch confidence reducing stress levels for theteam

## [From the Economic Graph to Economic Insights: Building the Infrastructure for Delivering Labor Market Insights from LinkedIn Data](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/from-the-economic-graph-to-economic-insights--building-the-infra)

 Publishing insights based on inaccurate or stale data can result in a loss of trust from our partners and has the potential to cause further negative impact

 5 Accordance Stateoftheart data infrastructure technologies and tooling are not sufficient to fully realize our vision

 In partnership with our K2 engineering team we are in the process of developing an API that will allow trusted partners to query LHR data for such use cases

## [LinkedIn Bug Bounty Program - One Year Anniversary of Public Launch](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/the-first-anniversary-of-the-public-launch-of-our-bug-bounty-pro)

 As we progressively ramped up our program from private to a public launch we saw a steady increase in the number of reports received

 As expected we saw a substantial increase in the number of invalid or nonsecurity reports as a public program compared to our time as a private program

 One of the major benefits of running a bug bounty program is the ability to work collaborate and build relationships with the top security researchers in the world
