## [고객의 목소리를 데이터로: 무신사의 VoC 대시보드 제작기 Part1 by UX파트](https://medium.com/musinsa-tech/voc-dashboard-development-part1-ec40412eb17f?source=rss----f107b03c406e---4)

 이 중 UX파트에서 자체적으로 수집하는 리서치 VoC는 제품에 대한 개선 의견 성격이 강한 것이 특징입니다

 이렇게 쌓인 VoC를 UX파트에서는 다양하게 활용하는데요

 그렇다면 고객을 조사하는 부서인 UX파트에서 왜 VoC를 수집하기 시작했을까요

 Through this project we explored the concept of using the head movement to be able to move the mouse cursor

 We wanted to give the users the option to reset the mouse cursor to the center of the screen using a facial gesture too

 We could also swap out the implementation of a field from GraphQL Shim to Video API with federation directives

 We developed a Replay Testing tool to verify that idempotent APIs were migrated correctly from the GraphQL Shim to the Video APIservice

 We covered three tools AB testing Replay Testing and Sticky Canaries that we used for the GraphQL Migration

 Sticky CanariesCanary deployments are an effective mechanism for validating changes to a production backend service in a controlled and limited manner thus mitigating the risk of unforeseen consequences that may arise due to the change

 We can complete the final step of migrating all the production traffic to the new system using the combination of gradual stepwise dialing and monitoring

 In addition it is important to document the entire migration process and keep records of any issues encountered and their resolution

## [Open Sourcing AvroTensorDataset: A Performant TensorFlow Dataset For Processing Avro Data](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/open-sourcing-avrotensordataset--a-performant-tensorflow-dataset)

 int64 scalar representing the number of records to read and parse per iteration

 In the ATDSDataset we propose a shuffle algorithm that samples the number of records to read from each Avro block and merges the read objects from multiple blocks as the batched output

 These blocks are split across the configured number of threads and parsed in parallel
