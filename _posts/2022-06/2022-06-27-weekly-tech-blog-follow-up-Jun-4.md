 MySQL 서버의 실행계획 수립Index Dive 단계에서 많은 CPU와 Disk storage 자원이 소모되는 경우 어떻게 튜닝할 수있을까

 MySQL 서버에서 쿼리가 실행되면 옵티마이저Optimizer는 통계 정보뿐만 아니라 실제 테이블의 데이터를 샘플링해서 확인 후 최종 사용할 실행 계획을 선택해요

 예를 들어서 eqrangeindexdivelimit200 으로 설정된 경우 MySQL 서버 옵티마이저는 동등 비교 회수가 200을 넘으면 Index Dive를 실행하지 않고 통계 정보만을 이용해서 실행 계획을 수립해요

 Last year we explored the effectiveness of anonymous code review by asking 300 developers to do their code reviews without the authors name at the top

 And through this work we want to inspire other companies to take a hard look at their own code reviews and to consider adopting anonymous author code review as part of their process as well
