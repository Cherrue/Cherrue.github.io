## [오픈소스 검증 도구: OLIVE CLI 소개](https://tech.kakao.com/2022/06/09/olive-cli/)

 저는 오픈소스기술파트에서 OLIVE Platform 개발과 프로젝트에 대한 오픈소스 검증을 담당하고 있습니다

  여기에서는 실시간 오픈소스 자동화 관리 서비스인 OLIVE Platform에 새롭게 추가된 OLIVE Command Line InterfaceCLI에 대해 이야기하려고 합니다

 OLIVE CLI를 개발하게 된 배경부터 주요 핵심 명령어들에 대해 알아보고 금융권 3사에서 비공개 베타 테스트CBT를 진행하며 적용한 사례를 공유합니다

## [Towards data quality management at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/towards-data-quality-management-at-linkedin)

 Data is at the heart of all our products and decisions at LinkedIn and the quality of our data is vital to our success

 The following figures show the actual arrival time and data volume of a dataset that is being consumed by the AI use case

 The previous three steps compose the data health monitoring services and automatically discovers all of the datasets in the ecosystem and collects their data quality metrics

## [Overcoming challenges with Linux cgroups memory accounting](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/overcoming-challenges-with-linux-cgroups-memory-accounting)

 The dip in cache usage by the application cgroup is due to a restart

 But this time the application cgroup memory is wrong

 This is because the pages for the index are already in memory but the new application cgroup is not accounting for this

## [Under the hood: Meta’s cloud gaming infrastructure](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/09/web/cloud-gaming-infrastructure/)

 While it will take a massive effort across the industry to bring the metaverse to fruition we believe creating the infrastructure and solving the challenges of cloud gaming are pointing us toward solutions for the metaverse as well

 Enabling cloud gaming at Meta meant developing a new hardware and software infrastructure to address the challenges inherent in cloud gaming

 Were also working with mobile network operators and carriers to significantly improve the latency in their access network

## [Introducing Zelos: A ZooKeeper API leveraging Delos](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/08/developer-tools/zelos/)

 First it notifies the Zelos ensemble that its time to transition and converts the ensemble from a follower of ZooKeeper to the leader of its own consensus protocol

 On startup it connects to ZooKeeper and creates a watch on the existence of this barrier node

 It then connects to the Zelos ensemble and confirms that the ensemble has observed the creation of the barrier node

## [Cache made consistent: Meta’s cache invalidation solution](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/08/core-data/cache-invalidation/)

 We want to help reduce the number of cache invalidation issues that engineers have to deal with and help make all caches with invalidations more consistent

 Understanding the unique challenges of cache invalidation is particularly challenging

 We want to measure cache consistency and sound an alarm when there are inconsistent entries in the cache

## [Building Background Effects for Clips](https://slack.engineering/building-background-effects-for-clips/)

 The remainder of the pipeline combines the segmentation mask and input video to generate the desired effect

 The challenge with background replacement is to find some edge around the mask that we can use to divide the foreground and background

 Finally the blurred mask is used to mix the webcam video and the blurred background image
